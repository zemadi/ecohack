<h1>Project for EcoHack Hackathon: May 9, 2014</h1>

<p>This project is still at a very preliminary stage. The goal from the one-day hackathon was to develop an idea and prototype for a climate change dashboard for businesses.</p>

<ol>To work on later:
<li> Gauge SVG size. The size of the SVG overrides the div width and takes the full screen. </li>
<li>Styling. Obviously, it's very minimal. </li>
<li>Need to create legend for polar area chart. </li>
<li>Need to create user accounts, user pages, and a running backend. </li>
</ol>

<p>More details to come! We hope to get this running and online in the next few weeks.</p>
